This is a beefed-up version of my more simple [CSV logger](/posts/unity-csv-logger-for-experiments/) packagae I previously released, focusing on doing the difficulat management of different stages of an experiment that are usually cumbersome. It also crucially alows for multithreaded FileIO which is especially importand in VR applications where we can not afford for frame times to exceed the target.
