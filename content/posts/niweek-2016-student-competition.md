  Winning the worldwide NI Student Competition and presenting at NI Week 2016
  in Austin, TX.


As my Mechanical Engineering Master's project, I was part of a team
which aimed to help make a fairly new field, rehabilitation robotics,
viable as a commercial service. To do this, my team made progress in two
areas, a new rehabilitation robot device, myPAM, and ALAN-Arm, a testing solution
for rehabilitation robots.

We presented in front of thousands on the keynote and demoed the device
to hundreds more on the show floor at the expo. We won the student
competition based on the project's innovation, complexity and societal
impact.
