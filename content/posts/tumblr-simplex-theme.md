  Free professional theme for Tumblr blogs


I made a theme for Tumblr. I’ve seen a lack of free professional themes so I thought I’d make one. It has custom links, variable widths, customisable colours and much more. If there are any problems just contact me.

To install, copy all the code from the link above. Then paste it into the custom html part of customize, overwriting all the old code. It will look weird, just press update, save, then close. You can then reopen customise to edit the settings.
