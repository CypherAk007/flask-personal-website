I'm a graduate of Mechanical Engineering, and now a PhD candidate in the area of cognitive science - with a particular interest in the use of VR to study human behaviour. Some of my interests:

* The study of human cognition, perception, & action
* Immersive technologies, and the challenges and opportunities they bring (technical, social, or otherwise)
* Data processing, visualisation and analysis
* Coding with craftsmanship: producing efficient, intuitive, and maintainable software
* Human factors, design and user experience
